# Microsoft's SASE partner ecosystem overview

Microsoft's Secure Access Service Edge (SASE) partner ecosystem is designed to provide organizations with a robust and flexible security framework. Microsoft collaborates with leading security vendors to ensure that its SASE solution can seamlessly integrate with various non-Microsoft products. This integration allows organizations to use their existing security investments while enhancing their overall security posture. In this overview, you'll explore the different types of partner integrations and coexistence offerings available, helping you to make informed decisions about how to best secure your network infrastructure.

Microsoft's SASE solution supports non-Microsoft integrations that provide you with flexibility to secure access to your resources with both Microsoft and non-Microsoft solutions. The goal of these integrations is twofold: ensure that non-Microsoft solutions work well with Microsoft's SASE solution, and enhance the experience for IT administrators and end users.

We work with our partners to deliver the following categories:

- **Partner integration offerings**: these integrations provide a comprehensive solution that deeply and seamlessly embeds advanced partner capabilities directly inside Microsoft's SASE solution, all within the same interface.
- **Partner coexistence offerings**: these integrations aim to optimize your experience as you deploy Microsoft's SASE solution along with your existing security stacks. 
- **Connectivity**: partners that demonstrate interoperability between their connectivity capabilities and Microsoft's Security Service Edge (SASE) solution.
- **Partner service offerings**: Partners that provide implementation services.
