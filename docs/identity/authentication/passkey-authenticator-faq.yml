    questions:
      - question: |
          Can I use Authenticator as a passkey provider on devices earlier than Android 14 or iOS 17?
        answer: |
          Authenticator uses operating system APIs as a passkey provider. 
          These APIs are available only on devices that run Android 14 and iOS 17 or later. 
          As a result, passkeys in Authenticator are only available on devices that run Android 14 or iOS 17 and later.
          Support for FIDO2 security keys on earlier versions of Android is coming soon.
      - question: |
          Do I need to enable Bluetooth to perform cross-device authentication?
        answer: |
          To complete cross-device registration or authentication using passkeys in Authenticator, you must enable Bluetooth on both the laptop and the mobile device, and both devices must also be connected to the internet. 
          Some organizations restrict Bluetooth usage, which includes the use of passkeys. 
          In such cases, organizations can allow passkeys by permitting Bluetooth pairing exclusively with passkey-enabled FIDO2 authenticators. 
          For more information about how to configure Bluetooth usage only for passkeys, see [Passkeys in Bluetooth-restricted environments](https://review.learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/identity-protection/passkeys/?branch=pr-en-us-10051&tabs=windows#passkeys-in-bluetooth-restricted-environments).
      - question: |
          Can I have multiple passkeys in Authenticator?
        answer: |        
          You can only have one passkey for each account in Authenticator. At this time, Authenticator only supports passkeys for Microsoft Entra ID.
      - question: |
          Can I use Authenticator app camera to scan the WebAuthn QR code for registration and authentication?
        answer: |
          You can use the Authenticator camera on Android to register and authenticate with passkeys. This option is useful if your organization hasn't pushed the system camera app to Android Work Profile. This capability isn't supported in the Authenticator app on iOS at this time.  
      - question: |
          Can I use passkeys in Authenticator without an internet connection?
        answer: |
          You can't use passkeys without an internet connection. 
          For same-device scenarios, the mobile device that contains the passkey must be connected to the internet. 
          For cross-device scenarios, both the device with the passkey and the secondary device you are authenticating on must be connected to the internet.  
      - question: |
          How can I prevent users from being looped between Authenticator and Security info when they add a passkey?
        answer: |
          If you configure an authentication strength Conditional Access policy that requires phishing-resistant authentication to access cloud apps, users can get caught in a loop when they try to sign in. An sample configuration of such a policy is: 

          - Condition: **All devices (Windows, Linux, MacOS, Windows, Android)** 
          - Targeted resource: **All cloud apps** 
          - Grant control: **Authentication strength â€“ Require passkey in Authenticator** 

          The policy creates a loop for the user because the authentication strength requires Authenticator, and the targeted resource is **All cloud apps**, which includes Authenticator. 
          As a result, when a user tries to add a passkey in Authenticator, they are directed to [Security info](https://mysignins.microsoft.com/security-info) for passkey registration. 
          But they only can add **Passkey in Microsoft Authenticator** as a registration option because of the authentication strength requirement. 

          For possible workarounds, see [Workarounds for an authentication strength Conditional Access policy loop](how-to-support-authenticator-passkey.md#workarounds-for-an-authentication-strength-conditional-access-policy-loop).
      - question: |
          Can I use passkeys in Authenticator on an Android corporate-owned device?
        answer: |
          Passkeys in Authenticator aren't supported on corporate-owned managed devices. Support for corporate-owned devices managed by Intune is coming soon.
