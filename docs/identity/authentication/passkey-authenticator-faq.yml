    questions:
      - question: |
          Can I use Authenticator as a passkey provider on devices earlier than Android 14 or iOS 17?
        answer: |
          Authenticator uses operating system APIs as a passkey provider. These APIs are available only on devices that run Android 14 and iOS 17 or later. As a result, passkeys in Authenticator are only available on devices that run Android 14 or iOS 17 and later.
      - question: |
          Do I need to enable Bluetooth to perform cross-device authentication?
        answer: |
          To complete cross-device registration or authentication using passkeys in Authenticator, you must enable Bluetooth on both the laptop and the mobile device, and both devices must also be connected to the internet. 
          Some organizations restrict Bluetooth usage, which includes the use of passkeys. 
          In such cases, organizations can allow passkeys by permitting Bluetooth pairing exclusively with passkey-enabled FIDO2 authenticators. 
          For more information about how to configure Bluetooth usage only for passkeys, see [Passkeys in Bluetooth-restricted environments](https://review.learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/identity-protection/passkeys/?branch=pr-en-us-10051&tabs=windows#passkeys-in-bluetooth-restricted-environments).
      - question: |
          Can I have multiple passkeys in Authenticator?
        answer: |        
          You can only have one passkey for each account in Authenticator. At this time, Authenticator only supports passkeys for Microsoft Entra ID.
      - question: |
          Can I use Authenticator app camera to scan the WebAuthn QR code for registration and authentication?
        answer: |
          You can use the Authenticator camera on Android to register and authenticate with passkeys. This option is useful if your organization hasn't pushed the system camera app to Android Work Profile. This capability isn't supported in the Authenticator app on iOS at this time.  
      - question: |
          Can I use passkeys in Authenticator without an internet connection?
        answer: |
          You can't use passkeys without an internet connection. 
          For same-device scenarios, the mobile device that contains the passkey must be connected to the internet. 
          For cross-device scenarios, both the device with the passkey and the secondary device you are authenticating on must be connected to the internet.  
      - question: |
          How can I prevent users from being looped between Authenticator and Security info when they add a passkey?
        answer: |
          This loop can occur if you configure an "All cloud apps" Conditional Access policy which requires users to use a passkey in Authenticator to proceed. A sample configuration would be:

          - Condition: **All devices (Windows, Linux, MacOS, Windows, Android)** 
          - Targeted resource: **All cloud apps** 
          - Grant control: **Authentication strength - Require phishing-resistant credentials** 
          
          Registration of credentials (e.g. passkey) by signing into the Authenticator is governed by the "All cloud apps" policy. In this instance, the user is attempting to register a passkey in the Authenticator but they must use a phishing-resistant credential to do so.
          Since the user doesn't have a phishing-resistant credential, they are directed to [Security info](https://mysignins.microsoft.com/security-info) for registration. When the user is in Security info, they can choose to add a different phishing-resistant credential, if enabled. However,
          the user will enter a loop if they choose to add a passkey in the Authenticator app as Security info will guide users to sign in to the app to do so. To avoid this loop, users can use the WebAuthn registration flow to setup a passkey in the Authenticator.
          Organizations can also tag their apps and explicitly apply CA policies to those instead of the "All cloud apps" CA policy or organizations can set up a CA policy for mobile platforms that allow users to use a Temporary Access Pass (TAP) in addiiton to phishing-resistant credentials which a user can then leverage to sign in to the Authenticator app and set up their passkey.
          For more information about how to workaround the loop, see [Workarounds for an authentication strength Conditional Access policy loop](how-to-support-authenticator-passkey.md)
